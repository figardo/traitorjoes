TraitorJoes.Joe.Shop.SlotFilled.3=I appreciate you remaining loyal.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Shop.HasPassive.1=You already have one of those!
TraitorJoes.Joe.Shop.HasPassive.2=What, were you expecting it to stack or something?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Shop.HasPassive.3=Sounds overpowered.

TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.2=You know, back in the day we were really thriving.
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.3=Bunch of really big names featured us on their socials, helped out a lot.
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.4=A few complained that our catalogue was too small, but we were really riding that high for a few years.
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.5=And now?
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.6=It seems like everyone started expecting us to be something that we're not.
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.7=If you were to ask me, most of the stuff our competition sold seemed superficial.
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.8=Items focused more on making a pretty spectacle rather than quelling any Trouble in Terrorist Town.
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.9=Regardless, the people seem to be addicted to 'em.
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.10=Literally, I've witnessed a few competitors of ours pretty much set up casinos.
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.11=These days we're considered boring.
TraitorJoes.Joe.HowsBusiness.12=I like to think we're just sensible.

TraitorJoes.Joe.MemberCard.1=Huh? A membership card?
TraitorJoes.Joe.MemberCard.2=Oh right, the radio ad.
TraitorJoes.Joe.MemberCard.3=Normally these things go for... I dunno, $20.
TraitorJoes.Joe.MemberCard.4=But since you're the first member we've had in a while, this one's on the house!

TraitorJoes.Joe.Redeem.4=Okay I forgot what the reward is.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Redeem.5=Oh, I know, I've got the reward written down on that radio ad script.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Redeem.6=It'll be somewhere around back, shouldn't be hard to find.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Redeem.7=Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.1=What were you hoping to find back there?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.2=Some kind of “easter egg”?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.3=Sorry, we only keep trade secrets on site.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.4=Now, the shareholders made me promise that if anybody discovered those secrets...
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.5=I'd kill 'em.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.6=Unfortunately, if I did that now, you'd just respawn.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.7=No fun.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.8=Hey, here's an idea...
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.9=Keep this between the two of us, and I'll give you weapons whenever you need 'em.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.10=Sounds like a fair deal to me.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.11=What? No, I don't care if you post it online.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.12=Just don't tell the shareholders that I let you live.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.Good.1=You were really focused on winning the prize, huh?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.Good.2=I like that.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.Good.3=Guess my shop has replay value.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.Good.4=Hey, here's an idea...
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.Good.5=Have a look through the trash back there.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Final.Good.6=You might be at least intrigued by what ya find.

TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign=Hey buddy, you read the sign?
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.Yes=Yeah.
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.No=What sign?
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.Yes1=So quit it with the noclippin' already!
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.Yes2=How would you like it if I noclipped around your store, looking through all your trade secrets?
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.No1=The one right next to where you were just noclipping!
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.No2=It said STRICTLY no noclipping!
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.Sorry=Okay, sorry.
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.WasntThere=Wasn't there when I looked.
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.WasntThere1=Very funny.
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.WasntThere2=What, do you think it just appeared out of thin air?
TraitorJoes.Joe.ReadTheSign.WasntThere3=You sound crazy.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Shot.1="Die already"?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Shot.2=Sorry pal, I'd need to get the shareholders to agree to something like that.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Shot.3=It doesn't sound like a good business move.

TraitorJoes.Joe.HatShot.1=Do you mind?
TraitorJoes.Joe.HatShot.2=The hat is a key part of my brand!
TraitorJoes.Joe.HatShot.3=I don't even have an animation to pick it back up!
TraitorJoes.Joe.HatShot.4=Ah whatever, come back later. I'll figure something out.

TraitorJoes.Joe.RadioShot.1=Sick of the radio eh?
TraitorJoes.Joe.RadioShot.2=That's okay, I also get tired of hearing my own voice.
TraitorJoes.Joe.RadioShot.3=Although in future, just turn off the radio with E.
TraitorJoes.Joe.RadioShot.4=There's only one thing more annoying than having that thing on all the time...
TraitorJoes.Joe.RadioShot.5=Having to tape it back together each week.

TraitorJoes.Joe.BackRoom.1=Look, as long as I'm around here, there'll be trade secrets to keep.
TraitorJoes.Joe.BackRoom.2=If they got out...
TraitorJoes.Joe.BackRoom.3=Who knows what the shareholders would think!
TraitorJoes.Joe.BackRoom.4=Don't go back there.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Physgun.1=Funny.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Physgun.2=Very funny.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Physgun.3=We're all gentlemen in here.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Physgun.4=We shoot each other with real guns.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Physgun.5=Keep using that DarkRP gizmo and bad things are gonna happen.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Toolgun.1=...
TraitorJoes.Joe.Toolgun.2=Look, I don't even wanna know what you just did to me.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Toolgun.3=Cut it out.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Toolgun.4=That thing can be a deadly weapon.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Ammo.1=You needed ammo that badly huh?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Ammo.2=I don't know what kind of gun stores you've been to, but normally...
TraitorJoes.Joe.Ammo.3=You buy the ammo first.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Fire.1=You know, I've tried the fiery look before and it didn't really work out.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Fire.2=Apparently it scares the customers or something.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Removed.Annoy="Oh I know! I'll remove him so that he forgets all about me!"
TraitorJoes.Joe.Removed.1=Please. You can't get rid of me that easily.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Removed.2=I've got a shop to run.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Display.1=What, does your local gun shop just let you take weapons from the displays?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Display.2=Sounds irresponsible.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Moved.1=I'm sure the place you're trying to take me to is wonderful.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Moved.2=Unfortunately, my shift doesn't end any time soon.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Moved.3=And the shareholders don't like it when I slack off.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Moved.4=We can reschedule our little date later.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Spray.1=Hey, I don't appreciate the graffiti pal.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Spray.2=Don't want to distract customers from the advertising, do we?

TraitorJoes.Joe.Spawn.1=Listen, this place is already quite cramped.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Spawn.2=Mall supervisors didn't give us much room to work with.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Spawn.3=So don't clutter up my shop, got it?

TraitorJoes.Joe.Bones.1=Gee, thanks.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Bones.2=Now the customers are gonna see a freak of nature when they walk in.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Bones.3=That means you, by the way.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Bones.4=I'm still handsome as ever.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Spec.1=You know I can't do business with a spectator right?

TraitorJoes.Joe.Spec.3=You can't physically hold anything I sell.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Cap.1=Hey, look! It's my biggest fan!
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Cap.2=Haven't seen someone wearing one of those in years.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Cap.3=In fact, haven't seen someone buy one of those in years...
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Cap.4=Ya know what? It's on the house.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Cap.5=Go out there and get me some free publicity.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Deerstalker.1=Oh yeah? You think you can do my job?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Deerstalker.2=Fine. You're hired. Get to work.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Deerstalker.3=What's that? You can't exchange credits for equipment items?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Deerstalker.4=Oh you're so fired.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Deerstalker.5=Gimme that thing.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Fedora.1=Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude to steal people's hats?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Fedora.2=Especially when they're a Traitor Joe's customer.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Fedora.3=I don't think his hat even respawns, so enjoy that one while you can.

TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Other.1=What the hell are you wearing?
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Other.2=Looks stylish.
TraitorJoes.Joe.Hat.Other.3=Let me sell it and I'll give you 20% of the profit I make.

TraitorJoes.Tony.Defib=Do you have anything that could revive a corpse?
TraitorJoes.Tony.Defib.1=What? Who told you I have one?
TraitorJoes.Tony.Defib.2=Oh I mean yeah, every Innocent man in the mob got one of them.
TraitorJoes.Tony.Defib.3=It's a very uh, Innocent tool that we use Innocently.
TraitorJoes.Tony.Defib.4=Listen, you can take it, just don't tell a soul where you got it from.
TraitorJoes.Tony.Defib.5=Capiche?

TraitorJoes.Tony.NameChange=Did you change your name?

TraitorJoes.Tony.RadioShot.2=Can't even enjoy some good radio these days.

TraitorJoes.Tony.Shot.1=Heh, yeah, that almost tickles pal.
TraitorJoes.Tony.Shot.2=You should see our guns, they do a lot more than that.

TraitorJoes.Tony.Toolgun.1=It's a perfectly good piece ya got there, you didn't have to strap all those wires to it.
TraitorJoes.Tony.Toolgun.2=Whatever ya did to it, it doesn't even deal damage any more!

TraitorJoes.Tony.Fire.1=Hey, not the suit!
TraitorJoes.Tony.Fire.2=This thing attracts broads, it doesn't repel flames!

TraitorJoes.BKU.Intro.1=Thanks for the defibrillator.

TraitorJoes.RadioStation.Text=Hey BKU,\n\nRegarding your idea for a store radio station at the new location, sounds great!\n\nI will begin work on it over the weekend.\n\nI've already produced a list of personnel that would be ideal to get this project off the ground.\n\nVoice actors would include (in hypothetical order):\nRichter Overtime\ndimbeak\nCalypso\nGoldec\nratlobber\nOsseus\nSjors\nPigSheepCowDuck\nYashirmare\nmatson01\nemaqed\ndacoobers\nfigardo\nStuffed Carlos\n\nWith songs created by:\nRichter Overtime and ratlobber\nBoyinaband and TheRPGMinx\n\nAnd additional mixing by:\ndimbeak\nratlobber\n\nHowever, since we are currently running on a tight budget, we can't afford any of the aforementioned people.\n\nDon't worry though, I'm a pretty good voice actor. :-)\n\nRegards,\nTraitor Joe
