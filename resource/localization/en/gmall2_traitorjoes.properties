TraitorJoes.RadioStation.Text=Hey BKU,\n\nRegarding your idea for a store radio station at the new location, sounds great!\n\nI will begin work on it over the weekend.\n\nI've already produced a list of personnel that would be ideal to get this project off the ground.\n\nVoice actors would include (in hypothetical order):\nRichter Overtime\ndimbeak\nCalypso\nGoldec\nratlobber\nOsseus\nSjors\nPigSheepCowDuck\nYashirmare\nmatson01\nemaqed\ndacoobers\nfigardo\nStuffed Carlos\n\nWith songs created by:\nRichter Overtime and ratlobber\nBoyinaband and TheRPGMinx\n\nAnd additional mixing by:\ndimbeak\nratlobber\n\nHowever, since we are currently running on a tight budget, we can't afford any of the aforementioned people.\n\nDon't worry though, I'm a pretty good voice actor. :-)\n\nRegards,\nTraitor Joe

TraitorJoes.NewLocation.Text=Hey BKU,\n\nGood to hear that the move into the GMall is coming along well.\n\nI've asked a few people for some additional help. Specifically:\n\n- crowtroopa helped me give this computer some Traitor Joe's branding!\n\n- Richter Overtime donated a poster to promote our new radio station!\n\nSuch sweethearts. I hope you give your thanks the next time you see 'em in the store.\n\nRegards,\nTraitor Joe
